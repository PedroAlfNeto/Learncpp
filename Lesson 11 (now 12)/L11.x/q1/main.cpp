/*
 Quizz 1:
 Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items:
    health potions, torches, and arrows.
 Create an enum to identify the different types of items, and an std::array to store the number of
    each item the player is carrying (the enumerators are used as indexes of the array).
 The player should start with 2 health potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows.
 Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns how many items the player has in total.
 Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems() as well as the number of torches.
