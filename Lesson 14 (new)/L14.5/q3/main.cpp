/*
 Quizz 3:
 Letâ€™s write a class that implements a simple stack from scratch.
 The class should be named Stack, and should contain:
    A private array of integers of length 10.
    A private integer to keep track of the size of the stack.
    A public member function named reset() that sets the size to 0.
    A public member function named push() that pushes a value on the stack.
        push() should return false if the array is already full, and true otherwise.
    A public member function named pop() that pops a value off the stack and returns it.
        If there are no values on the stack, the code should exit via an assert.
    A public member function named print() that prints all the values in the stack.
