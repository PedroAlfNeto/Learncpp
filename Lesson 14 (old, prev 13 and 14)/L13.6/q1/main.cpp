/*
 Quizz 1:
 Write a class named RGBA that contains 4 member variables of type std::uint8_t named
	m_red, m_green, m_blue, and m_alpha (#include cstdint to access type std::uint8_t).
 Assign default values of 0 to m_red, m_green, and m_blue, and 255 to m_alpha.
 Create a constructor that uses a member initializer list that allows the user to:
	initialize values for m_red, m_blue, m_green, and m_alpha.
Include a print() function that outputs the value of the member variables.

If you need a reminder about how to use the fixed width integers,
	please review lesson 4.6 -- Fixed-width integers and size_t.

Hint: If your print() function isn’t working correctly, make sure you’re casting uint8_t to an int.

The following code should run:

	The following sample (main) program should compile:
*/
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdint>

class RGBA
{
private:
	const std::uint8_t m_red;
	const std::uint8_t m_green;
	const std::uint8_t m_blue;
	const std::uint8_t m_alpha;

public:
	// Class constructor
	RGBA(std::uint8_t red = 0, std::uint8_t green = 0, std::uint8_t blue = 0, std::uint8_t alpha = 255)
		: m_red{red}, m_green{green}, m_blue{blue}, m_alpha{alpha}
	{
	}

	void print()
	{
		std::cout << "r=" << static_cast<int>(m_red) 
		<< " g=" << static_cast<int>(m_green) 
		<< " b=" << static_cast<int>(m_blue) 
		<< " a=" << static_cast<int>(m_alpha) << '\n';
	}
};

int main()
{
	RGBA teal{0, 127, 127};
	teal.print();

	return 0;
}
