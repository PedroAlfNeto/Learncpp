 Quizz 3:
 Name two reasons why we prefer to pass arguments by const reference instead of 
    by non-const reference whenever possible.
*/

    Q3:
    possible= not necessary to modify value of referenced variable
        1- Avoids changing the value of the referenced variable by mistake (read-only)
        2- A const reference-parameter can accept a modifiable lvalue, a non-modifiable lvalue, or an rvalue as an argument.*

/*
 Quizz 4:
 What is the difference between a const pointer and a pointer-to-const?
*/

Q4: 
    A const pointer cannot be "reseated"->re-pointed* to point to a different vairable/address (even if the same type)
    A pointer-to-const cannot modify the vairable's value to which is pointing to
