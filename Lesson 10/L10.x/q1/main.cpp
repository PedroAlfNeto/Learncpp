/*
 Quizz 1:
 1-In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters, because everyone likes fighting monsters.
 Declare a struct that represents your monster.
 The monster should have a type that can be one of the following:
    an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime. Use an enum class for this.

 2- Each individual monster should also have a name (use a std::string or std::string_view),
    as well as an amount of health that represents how much damage they can take before they die.
 Write a function named printMonster() that prints out all of the structâ€™s members.
 Instantiate an ogre and a slime, initialize them using an initializer list,
    and pass them to printMonster().

 Your program should produce the following output:
    This Ogre is named Torg and has 145 health.
    This Slime is named Blurp and has 23 health.
